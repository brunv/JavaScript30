    /* however what happens when we update that array?
    now here is the problem!
    oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array! */

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Max';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;   // but we made a reference...
    //captain.number = 99;
    //console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age:12});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    captain3.age = 50;
    console.log(person, captain3);
    console.clear();

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
